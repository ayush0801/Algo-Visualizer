# Algorithm Visualizer :mag:

Algorithm Visualizer is a website that allows users to visualize different algorithms in a visual and interactive way. The website includes the following categories of algorithms:

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Sorting Algorithms
- [x] Bubble Sort
- [x] Insertion Sort
- [x] Merge Sort
- [x] Quick Sort

## :runner: Pathfinding Algorithms
- [x] Dijkstra
- [x] A* Search

## :rocket: Getting Started

Or you can check the live demo of the project :point_right: [here](https://cosmic-moxie-05df0c.netlify.app/) :point_left:

To get started with Algorithm Visualizer, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayush0801/Algo-Visualizer.git
```

This command will create a copy of the repository on your local machine in a new directory named "Algo-Visualizer".

You can also use any Git GUI tool like GitKraken, SourceTree, TortoiseGit etc.
You can check the documentation of those tools to know how to clone the repo.

Once you have the repository on your machine, you can navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running the command:

```bash
npm install
```

:computer: Running the project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project by running the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and you should be able to access the website at http://localhost:3000.
